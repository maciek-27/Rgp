\title{RexIO library 1.1 design requirements}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  Following document describes design requirements for 1.1 version of
  RexIO library specification. It covers basic functionality, that has
  to be implemented, design patterns that must be obeyed and other
  project goals, that need do be achieved. 
\end{abstract}

\section{RexIO Platform}

Current (1.0) version of RexIO library covers two basic functional
modules: first implemented as librexio, covering basic screen operations
and second implemented as librexiotk, encompassing basic UI
construction toolkit. In 1.1 third module will be included, covering
networking procedures. This will be classes representing running
server, active client connection etc.

These three modules together will form comprehensive application
framework sufficient to easily create online, multi-user software,
that provides  customizability,  performance and 
maintainability. Please note, that this is very early stage of design,
and everything may change before we start implementing it.

\section{RexIO 1.1 networking module (\texttt{RexIO::Net})}

The networking module will (as said above) contain set of classes
implementing basic features of typical network application. Namespace
for this module will be 

\begin{itemize}
\item \Class{Server} class --- implementing listening
  socket. Creating \Class{ClientConnection} object for each incoming
  connection. May easily be started to listen, and stopped (when
  associated \Class{ConnectionPool} is empty).
\item \Class{ConnectionPool} implementing set of active client connections
  associated with running Server.
\item \Class{ClientConnection} object is created for every incoming
  connection by Server. It contains pair of standard C++ streams to
  communicate with client. New thread is created by RexIO for each
  ClientConnection.
\end{itemize}

\section{RexIO 1.1 screen module (\texttt{RexIO::Scr})}

Core library module will also encounter major improvements

\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{Support for mouse operations.} These improvements may
  require changes in all descendents of \Class{\_\_ScreenConnection}
  class, which, \textit{nb.} will be renamed to
  \Class{ScreenConnection} as well as adding new functions to
  \Class{Connection} object
\item Full level 1 of Unicode implementation, including RTL and LTR
  text directions.
\item Optimize screen operations in terms of both: speed and transfer.
\item Introduce support for \texttt{SIGWINCH}
\item Recognize full PC keyboard, including recognition of as many as
  possible keys with Ctrl/Alt/Shift pressed (yes, this includes
  processing \texttt{UNIX} signals for local connections).
\item imtroduce Extended/Buffered subwindow types
\end{itemize}

\section{RexIO 1.1 UI toolkit module (\texttt{RexIO::Scr::Tk})}

\begin{itemize}
\item Make use of mouse support
\item Introduce new widgets crucial for real-life application, that
  including (but not limited to)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item TextEdit
  \item ListBox
  \item Frameset 
  \item Table (as for spreadsheet programs)
  \item A window, that may be scrolled
  \item TextMap (or TextCanvas) - component for buffered, incrementally 
	changed ascii-art graphics, rogue-like game maps etc.
  \end{itemize}
\item Introduce better support for L10n/i18n
\item Improve stylesheet support
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary}
1.1 will be a comprehensive platform for real-life multi-user applications,
including important features, which, due to lack of time, are absent
in 1.0. Enhanced interface (including networking module) will enable
easy transition to portability to non-UNIX operating systems.

		  BufferedSubScreen differs from basic SubScreen in many ways,
		  in particular it has it's own buffer and therefore it's
		  operations does not affect parent screen unless it's
		  refreshed.

		  Key differnces between SmartSubScreen and basic SubScreen is,
		  that it:
		  - shifts contents up by ext_top and left by ext_left
		  - allows writing space of (ext_left + _w + ext_right)
		  horizontal and (ext_top + _h + ext_bottom) vertical (so it's
		  internal size is bigger than displayed size). It crops
		  everything, that does not fit in this internal size, but
		  fits in external. It throws exceptions connected w/ range
		  only if internal range limit is broken.
