To compile this software library you need:

\begin{itemize}
\item POSIX compatible operating system
\item C++ compiler
\item boost libraries (memory and threads)
\item cmake build system
\end{itemize}

When these dependencies are satisfied, you may try to generate UNIX
makefile using following command (dot is important - it represents
,,current path'') in root directory.
\index{cmake}
\index{compile}
\begin{verbatim}
cd **Directory, where RexIO is unpacked**
cmake .
\end{verbatim}

When they are finally  generated, program is compiled in usual way

\begin{verbatim}
make
\end{verbatim}

\index{install}
When 1.0 release candidate will be ready, install target will be added
enabling you to install this library in your system with all other
libraries, and use it for all your programs by just typing

\begin{verbatim}
make install
\end{verbatim}

When for some reason you will decide, you do not need this library
anymore, you may type

\begin{verbatim}
make uninstall
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Linking your programs against RexIO library}
